## An endless runner featuring SPIDERS.

Created by Shaina Mishra, Rosie Longo, Chantel Gee, and Daren Bartolucci.

Completed on May 3, 2021.

### Technically interesting aspects
* Two levels with a transition between them
* Sliding mechanic along with jumping 
* Changing hitbox sizes on input
* Screen shake effect when getting hit by an obstacle

### Visual Style
We wanted the game to be a bit darker in tone and chose a topic that we find a bit scary (spiders!).
Our game features all original hand drawn assets and animation as well as original music and sfx.
